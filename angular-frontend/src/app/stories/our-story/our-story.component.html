      <h3>How we met:</h3>
      <p>In the Spring of 2011 I was working as a hostess at Applebees in Solon, Ohio. Bryan was on summer break from
        The Ohio State University and he came back to work. It felt like everyone at Applebees already knew who he was
        except for me. Throughout the summer we worked many shifts together and I even went to visit him a few times
        on my days off. Over the next 6 months we became closer friends and we made sure that we stayed in touch even
        after he went back to college. On November 26th 2011 we went on our first date.
      </p>
      <h3 class="mt-5">Our Journey:</h3>
      <p>Over the next 6 years we had to work through the struggles of a long-distance relationship. I was in
        Cleveland taking classes to obtain my Bachelors at Kent State University and my Masters at John Carroll
        University while Bryan finished his bachelors and began working at JPMorgan Chase. At first, we did not see
        each other for months at a time but as our relationship grew stronger we did our best to see each other every
        two weeks. Either I would make a trip to Columbus or Bryan would come back to Cleveland for the weekend. Since
        we lived miles apart we had many long skype dates where we would talk and laugh all night until I just
        couldnâ€™t stay awake any longer.</p>
      <h3 class="mt-5">Our Engagement:</h3>
      <p>In October of 2017 we planned a weekend vacation to Niagara Falls. On the second day of the trip we had an
        adventurous morning exploring the area. Every time we stopped to take a photo or get water Bryan would place
        the drawstring bag on the ground and kneel down to get items from the bag. I was wondering why he was going
        through all that effort instead of just reaching into the bag. Then the afternoon came and we went on the
        White Water Walk to see the rapids down river. We walked back and forth between the overlooks until Bryan asked
        if we could take a photo together. Again, he set the bag down to get out the camera but to my surprise a
        camera did not come out of the bag. He pulled out a ring box and popped the question!! It was such an
        unforgettable moment and we had a beautiful view of the rapids in the background. We even had an audience on
        the boardwalk above who all clapped and congratulated us on our engagement.</p>
